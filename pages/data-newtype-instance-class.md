# data, type, newtype, instance, class

One of the first things to confuse me about Haskell was the number of keywords related to types. The five (I know, 5 isn't <i>that</i> many) I've counted in Haskell 98 are `data`{.haskell}, `type`{.haskell}, `newtype`{.haskell}, `instance`{.haskell}, and `class`{.haskell}. I was unable to find a comprehensive discussion of what each of them means and how they are related to each other. I'll break these keywords up linto 2 related sets. `data`{.haskell}, `type`{.haskell}, and `newtype`{.haskell} are all ways to declare a new type. `instance`{.haskell} and `class`{.haskell} are slightly different. Let's take a closer look at them.

## data, type, newtype

`data`{.haskell} is used to declare a new algebraic data type. We can use it to create a boolean or, in this case, the maybe monad:

```haskell
data Bool = True | False
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

`type`{.haskell} is used to create an alias for an algebraic data type. A good example of this is included in the Prelude:

```haskell
type String = [Char]
```

`newtype`{.haskell} acts similarly to `type`{.haskell} with a syntax akin to `data`{.haskell}. Thus we can write the following:

``` haskell
newtype Radius = Radius Double
data Diameter = Diameter Double
```

Okay, so what's the difference between newtype and data? Three things (that I'm aware of):

* `newtype`{.haskell} can only have a single constructor taking a single argument.
* `newtype`{.haskell} creates a strict value constructor and `type`{.haskell} creates a lazy one (see <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>).
* `newtype`{.haskell} introduces no runtime overhead.

## class, instance

A typeclass is a way to guarantee that a type implements certain functions (or data). A type is declared to implement the functions using the keyword `instance`{.haskell}. An example will be helpful:

``` haskell
--Normally I would use Double, but Int's will be easier to read
type Point = (Int, Int)
data Triangle = Triangle Point Point Point deriving (Show)
data Square = Square Point Point Point Point deriving (Show)

class Shape a where
  rotate :: a -> a
  simple :: a

instance Shape Triangle where
  rotate (Triangle x y z) = Triangle z x y
  simple = Triangle (0, 0) (1, 0) (0, 1)

instance Shape Square where
  rotate (Square w x y z) = Square z w x y
  simple = Square (0, 0) (1, 0) (1, 1) (0, 1)
```

As you can see, we first define 3 simple types. Next, the "`class Shape ...`{.haskell}" bit, that's the typeclass definition. All we're doing is telling the compiler what must be defined for an instance of `Shape`{.haskell}. With the `instance`{.haskell} keyword, we make our classes instances of `Shape`{.haskell} by defining the necessary stuff (i.e. rotate and simple). Let's try it in GHCi:

```
Prelude> :l shape.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main.             ( shape.hs, interpreted )
*Main> simple :: Square
Square (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1)
*Main> rotate it
Square (0,1) (0,0) (1,0) (1,1)
*Main> simple :: Triangle
Triangle (0,0) (1,0) (0,1)
*Main> rotate it
Triangle (0,1) (0,0) (1,0)
*Main> rotate it
Triangle (1,0) (0,1) (0,0)
```

Cool! Because `Square`{.haskell} and `Triangle`{.haskell} instantiate `Shape`{.haskell}, we know that we can call rotate on them. That's all a typeclass does. I tend to think of them as an interface or a contract.

## Summary

Remember, `data`{.haskell}, `type`{.haskell} and `newtype`{.haskell} are about making types. `instance`{.haskell} and `class`{.haskell} are about making typeclasses.

PS, there's another keyword, `deriving`{.haskell}, that could fit in this discussion. It seems less confusing to <em>me</em>, so I won't cover it.
