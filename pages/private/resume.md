## Projects:

[github.com/joelburget](https://github.com/joelburget)

## Noteworthy / significant contributions:

Unfortunately most of my paid work is not open-source. However, I do have some public projects I'm proud of.

* [khan/react-components](https://github.com/khan/react-components):
  React components originally from within Khan Academy that I open-sourced. This is the first example that I know of publishing React components on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), now standard practice.
* [Khan/perseus](https://github.com/Khan/perseus):
  Khan Academy's exercise editing system. I wrote the integration between
  Perseus and the main website. Creating and saving exercises; creating,
  saving, moving, renaming questions within an exercise.
* [Khan/KAS](https://github.com/Khan/KAS):
  Khan Academy's computer algebra system. I created simple physics / units of
  measure support, so you can, say, answer a question in /kg/, when the answer
  was originally stated in /g/.
* [joelburget/react-live-editor](https://github.com/joelburget/react-live-editor)
  A tool for live editing react components in the browser, used on the react-components [landing page](http://khan.github.io/react-components/).
* [joelburget/pigment](https://github.com/joelburget/pigment)
  An experiment in programming language design. Very much a work-in-progress.
  This was originally a fork of the Epigram programming language, but is now
  based on more practical JavaScript tooling.
* [joelburget/react-haskell](https://github.com/joelburget/react-haskell)
  Bindings in Haskell for Facebook's React JavaScript library. It works well
  considering that it's Haskell running in the browser to drive UIs. But this
  is the project where I learned when to quit.
  I wrote about using react-haskell for user interfaces [on my website](http://joelburget.com/react-haskell/).
* [joelburget/haste-compiler:commonjs](https://github.com/joelburget/haste-compiler/tree/commonjs)
  I took an existing Haskell-to-JavaScript compiler and integrated it with
  conventional JavaScript tools (CommonJS modules), so that you can more easily
  use Haskell and JavaScript together.

Many of my projects fall in this niche I've carved out for myself in the intersection between UI and typed functional programming. I enjoy applying the lessons I've learned from each domain to the other.

## Work:

* Khan Academy - Software Developer (2011-2015): I worked on many things during my time at Khan Academy -- search / autocomplete, tooling, frontend UI, etc. Full-stack Python / JavaScript web development.
* Contractor (Oct 2015 - present): I'm working as front-end web contractor with a specialiation in React / Flux. I'm currently working with [Spring](https://www.shopspring.com/) where I built their web search feature.

## Education:

BS Mathematics, BS Computer and Information Science with honors. Spring 2012, Ohio State University.
