## Noteworthy / significant contributions:

Unfortunately most of my paid work is not open-source. However, I do have some public projects I'm proud of.

* [khan/react-components](https://github.com/khan/react-components): React components originally from within Khan Academy that I open-sourced. This is the first example that I know of publishing React components on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), now standard practice.
* [Khan/perseus](https://github.com/Khan/perseus): Khan Academy's exercise editing system. I wrote the integration between Perseus and the main website. Creating and saving exercises; creating, saving, moving, renaming questions within an exercise.
* [Khan/KAS](https://github.com/Khan/KAS): Khan Academy's computer algebra system. I created simple physics / units of measure support, so you can, say, answer a question in /kg/, when the answer was originally stated in /g/.
* [joelburget/react-live-editor](https://github.com/joelburget/react-live-editor): A tool for live editing react components in the browser, used on the react-components [landing page](http://khan.github.io/react-components/).
* [joelburget/pigment](https://github.com/joelburget/pigment): An experiment in programming language design. Very much a work-in-progress.  This was originally a fork of the Epigram programming language, but is now based on more practical JavaScript tooling.
* [joelburget/react-haskell](https://github.com/joelburget/react-haskell): Bindings in Haskell for Facebook's React JavaScript library. It works well considering that it's Haskell running in the browser to drive UIs. But this is the project where I learned when to quit.  I wrote about using react-haskell for user interfaces [on my website](http://joelburget.com/react-haskell/).
* [joelburget/haste-compiler:commonjs](https://github.com/joelburget/haste-compiler/tree/commonjs): I took an existing Haskell-to-JavaScript compiler and integrated it with conventional JavaScript tools (CommonJS modules), so that you can more easily use Haskell and JavaScript together.  <div style={{margin: '20px 0 40px'}}><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DyFcrJL6kxk?rel=0" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen /></div>

Many of my projects fall in this niche I've carved out for myself in the intersection between UI and typed functional programming. I enjoy applying the lessons I've learned from each domain to the other.

## Work:

* Khan Academy - Software Developer (2011-2015): I worked on many things during my time at Khan Academy -- search / autocomplete, tooling, frontend UI, etc. Full-stack Python / JavaScript web development.
* Consultant (Oct 2015 - Feb 2016): I worked as a front-end web consultant with a specialiation in React / Flux. I worked with [Spring](https://www.shopspring.com/) where I built their web search feature and [AlphaSheets](http://www.alphasheets.com/) where I helped with architecture and best practices.
* JP Morgan - New Product Development Engineer - Vice President (Feb 2016 - Current): I'm currently working on adding Raft-based consensus to the Ethereum Virtual Machine / Blockchain. I previously split time between a developing a functional programming language called Hopper and front-end web development and design.

## Education:

BS Mathematics, BS Computer and Information Science with honors. Spring 2012, Ohio State University.
